# Unit 2 - Data for Social Good Project

## Introduction

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As a video game enthusiast, <br> 
> I want to display stats about top games, <br> 
> so that I can satisfy others' curiosity about popularity/suggestions.

## Dataset 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drahulsingh/list-of-best-selling-ps4-games
- **Game** (String) - name of the game
- **Copies Sold** (String) - however many copies of the game were sold
- **Release Date** (String) - when the game was released
- **Genre** (String) - genre/type of game
- **Developer** (String) - company that developed the game
- **Publisher** (String) - company that published the game


## Description 
For this project, we took the data from Kaggle about Video Games which included the stats of the top games played. We took this data and we organized everything into an easy to read format for the user and displayed it in the console. Our team chose this data set because it was something majority of us were passionate about.
